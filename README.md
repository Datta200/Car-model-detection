# Car-model-detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect and identify car models from images. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of car images. 
This are the important libraries
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense,Dropout,Convolution2D,MaxPooling2D,Flatten #action detectionimport tensorflow
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import HTML

use google colab for better accuracy and results
Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, you need to preprocess the data
Model Training
To train the mode
This will train the CNN on the preprocessed data and save the trained model to the models/ directory.
